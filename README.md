**Tabletop roleplaying on the web.**


What is it?
-----------
A web based system, written in PHP, for GM:ing and playing tabletop RPGs over the web.

The system is a mix of a chat and a forum where you post your updates to a game and then see them in different channels.


### Games
Play is held within a Game. A Game is typically an adventure or a campaign. Every game has one GM and any number of players. Players can be given the status of deputy GM.

A game can be Open or Closed. Open games can be joined by anyone, Closed games are invite only.

A game can be Public or Hidden. Public games can be seen by anyone, Hidden games can only be found using the game ID.


### Posting
All posting in a game is done through a unified chat box. Paragraphs and words should be marked up. There are different kinds of paragraphs:

* Immersive
    - __Dialogue:__ What a character says.
    - __Description:__ What a character does.
    - __GM:__ A description by the GM, not tied to any character.
* Non-immersive
    - __Private:__ A message between two players or a player and the GM. The GM can see all private messages.
    - __Off-game:__ A message not belonging to the actual game.
    - __Normal:__  Any other message.


### Channels
The user can create channels to separate different parts of a post and make it easier to follow what is happening. One channel for immersive messages and one for non-immersive is a good start.
